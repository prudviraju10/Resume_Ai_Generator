EXPERIENCE
Data Scientist Jul 2021 - Present
Hitachi Digital Systems Hyderabad
Worked on machine learning and generative AI solutions for business problems, and used python for tasks like PII data masking and
automation of application servers admin tasks.
Intelligent Troubleshooting System
Developed an intelligent troubleshooting assistant for application server admins using LLMs and LangGraph to automate common
diagnostic tasks like checking disk space, service status, and log files.
Enabled faster and consistent issue resolution, reducing manual effort for support teams by automating routine investigation steps.
Internal Profile Matching System
Built a Resume-RAG system for internal talent matching using LangGraph, ChromaDB, and Azure OpenAI, enabling retrieval of top
bench profiles based on incoming project requirements.
Improved profile to requirement matching efficiency for the RMG team, enabling faster and more accurate talent identification.
Churn Prediction
Developed a telecom churn prediction model using Decision Trees, XGBoost, and LightGBM; achieved 94% recall with lgbm after
EDA, feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning.
Analyzed key factors behind customer churn using SHAP values, providing actionable and explainable insights to business teams.
Reduced churn by 9%, segmenting customers with decile and lift charts to target high-risk segments and optimize retention strategies.
PROJECTS
Data Analysis & Business Insights
https://github.com/prudviraju10/data_analysis/tree/main
Performed detailed exploratory data analysis(EDA) on business case studies to derive actionable insights for decision-making.
Applied statistical hypothesis testing (Z-test, T-test, ANOVA, chi-square) to validate assumptions about data.
Cleaned and transformed datasets, handled outliers and missing data, and implemented standardization/ encoding techniques for
preparing data for reporting and model building.
Delivery Time Estimation
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qPcLUGU7scwIANvCzWlYe_OVRKaordRa/view?usp=sharing
Estimated delivery times for a food delivery app, achieving a MAPE of 6%, enhancing service efficiency.
Analyzed data to pinpoint peak order times, filling missing values and transforming features to effectively manage outliers.
Developed a Sequential Keras model with Adam optimizer and ReLU activation, utilizing Optuna for hyperparameter tuning, batch
normalization and regularization for generalization.
AI-Powered Chatbot
https://aillmdemoapp.streamlit.app/
Built a three-page AI app using Streamlit, integrating Llama 3.3 70b model(groq api), LangChain/Langgraph, and ChromaDB.
Designed chatbots with generic Q&A, RAG capabilities for document-based queries and AI agent with tools.
Utilized Google embeddings for semantic search and enhanced response accuracy. Streamlined document upload and indexing via
ChromaDB, enabling efficient vector search. Used wikipedia and search tools to give llm with more knowledge sources.
Movie Recommender System
https://github.com/prudviraju10/recommender_system
Developed a personalized movie recommender system using user-based and item-based collaborative filtering with Pearson
Correlation and Cosine Similarity to enhance user engagement and content discovery.
Applied matrix factorization to handle sparse user-item matrices, improving prediction accuracy and recommendation relevance.
